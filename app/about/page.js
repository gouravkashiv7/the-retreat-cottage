            Where luxury meets serenity in the tranquil hills near Kasauli. The
            Retreat Cottage offers an exclusive homestay experience that blends
            modern comfort with rustic charm, creating your perfect mountain
            sanctuary away from the hustle of city life.

            Our property features 3 elegantly appointed villa rooms and 2
            charming wooden cabins, each designed to provide ultimate privacy
            and comfort. But what truly sets us apart is the experience of
            waking up to breathtaking mountain views, spending your days
            exploring pine-scented trails, and unwinding in your private space
            surrounded by nature's tranquility.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is where you create lasting memories, surrounded by the beauty
            of the Himalayas. It's a place to slow down, rejuvenate, and
            rediscover the simple joys of life in a beautiful and peaceful
            setting.
